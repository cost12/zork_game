Big:
[] allow items with same name
    have unique id for equality/ dicts, dict[str,Named] -> dict[str,list[Named]] and figure out which one based on context/ asking questions
    new data structure like dict?
[] input translator
    multiple grammars
    word tree (items/actions with multiple words)

Not fully applied/ used:
[] responses
    Target/actor/tool response should depend on Action, State, and success (of Action)
    decide what response/responsestrings should be like with multiple targets/tools
[] action requirements (use them)
    Targets/tools have requirements for being used -> State?
    Rooms have requirements for actions in them (light for vision)

Low Priority:
[] allow for different starting states in state graphs

    return a tuple of an Action and inputs so CPU controlled Characters can make decisions more easily.
    create a more complex NPCController
    convert string into and Action and inputs and return Action, inputs
[] actions
    see more at __ItemDetails (items)
[] special text/ features
    see more at __SpecialDeets (rooms)
[] multiplayer
