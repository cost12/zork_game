    "description": "You stand at the edge of a large room full of treasure, riches beyond your wildest imagination. Gold, silver and platinum coins pile high, magical weapons glint and glow, enchanted scrolls sit amongst precious gemstones glimmering prismatically. On the floor is a simple mosaic depicting a hand holding a coin and an arrow pointing to a skull and crossbones. The message is clear: touch, and die."
